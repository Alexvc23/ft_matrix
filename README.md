## 1. What is a Vector ($\mathbf{v}$) ? 

### **a. Simple Definition**
A **vector** is a way to represent both a **magnitude** (size) and a **direction**. Think of it as an arrow pointing from one place to another.

### **b. Everyday Example**
Imagine you're giving someone directions: "Walk 3 blocks north and 4 blocks east." This direction can be represented as a vector because it has both length (how far) and direction (where to).

### **c. Mathematical Representation**
In math, a vector is usually written as an ordered list of numbers. For example:
- **2D Vector**: $[x, y] \,\,i.e\; \, [3, 4]$
- **3D Vector**: $[x, y, z] \,\,i.e\, \,[1, 5, 2]$

These numbers represent the vector's components along each axis (like north/south and east/west).

### **d. Visual Representation**
- **2D Vector**: Picture a flat graph with an x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical). A vector $[3, 4]$ starts at the origin (0,0) and points to the position (3,4).

- **3D Vector**: Imagine adding a z-axis (depth) to the graph. A vector $[1, 5, 2]$ points into this three-dimensional space.

    </details>

### **e. Uses in Algebra**
In algebra, vectors are used to solve systems of equations, represent points in space, and perform operations like addition and scalar multiplication (changing the size of the vector).

### **f. Uses in Computer Science**
Vectors are fundamental in computer graphics (representing positions and movements), machine learning (storing data as numerical lists), and physics simulations (modeling forces and velocities).


### The Components of a Vector from Its Endpoints


When you have a vector defined by two points 
$A(x_1, y_1)$  and $B(x_2, y_2)$, 
the most common way to find its components **(y-vertical-component and x-horizontal-component)** (in 2D) is to subtract the coordinates of \( A \) from the coordinates of \( B \). In other words:

$$
\overrightarrow{AB} = (\,x_2 - x_1, \; y_2 - y_1\,).
$$

- **(horizontal) X-component:** $x_2 - x_1$
- **(Vectical)Y-component:** $y_2 - y_1$


This pair of numbers tells you how far you move horizontally and vertically to go from \( A \) to \( B \).
 
1. If  $x_2 - x_1$ is **positive**, the vector moves to the **right**.  
2. If  $x_2 - x_1$ is **negative**, it moves to the **left**.  
3. If  $y_2 - y_1$ is **positive**, it moves **upward**.  
4. If  $y_2 - y_1$ is **negative**, it moves **downward**.

### Graphical Example

Consider points $A(1, 2)$ and $B(4, 6)$:

- **x-component:** $4 - 1 = 3$  
- **y-component:** $6 - 2 = 4$

The vector $\overrightarrow{AB}$ can be represented as $(3, 4)$.

### **Calculating the Magnitude** $||\mathbf{v}||$

### **a. Simple Definition**
The **magnitude** of a vector measures its length or size. It tells you how long the vector is in space.

### **b. Everyday Example**
Imagine walking from your home to a friend's house. The distance you walk represents the magnitude of the displacement vector between the two points.

### **c. Mathematical Representation**
For a vector $\mathbf{v} = [x, y]$ in 2D or $\mathbf{v} = [x, y, z]$ in 3D, the **magnitude** $||\mathbf{v}||$ is calculated using the following formula:


- **2D Vector:**

$$
||\mathbf{v}|| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

- **3D Vector:**

$$
||\mathbf{v}|| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
$$

### **d. Example Calculation**

- **2D Example:**
    
    Consider the vector $\mathbf{v} = [3, 4] $.
    
$$
||\mathbf{v}|| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
$$

- **3D Example:**
    
    Consider the vector $\mathbf{u} = [1, 2, 2] $.
    
$$
||\mathbf{u}|| = \sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4 + 4} = \sqrt{9} = 3
$$

## Vector Addition and Subtraction:

### Basic Operations

#### Vector Addition
To add two vectors, add their corresponding components:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{u} &= [2, 3] \\
\mathbf{v} &= [4, 1] \\
\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} &= [2+4, 3+1] = [6, 4]
\end{aligned}
$$

### ðŸ‘€ Visual Representation

    <img src="./assets/vector_addition.png" alt="Vector Addition" width="50%" height="50%" />
</details>

#### Vector Subtraction
To subtract vectors, subtract their corresponding components:


$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{u} &= [5, 7] \\
\mathbf{v} &= [2, 3] \\
\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v} &= [5-2, 7-3] = [3, 4]
\end{aligned}
$$

Here's another example with a negative vector:


$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{u} &= [-2, 4] \\
\mathbf{v} &= [3, -1] \\
\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v} &= [-2-3, 4-(-1)] = [-5, 5]
\end{aligned}
$$

### Key Properties

- Addition is commutative: `u + v = v + u`
- Subtraction is not commutative: `u - v â‰  v - u`
- Zero vector addition: `v + [0,0] = v`

## Scalar Multiplication

### **a. Simple Definition**
**Scalar Multiplication** is when you multiply a vector by a single number (scalar), affecting its magnitude but not its direction (unless negative).

### **b. Mathematical Representation**
For a scalar $a$ and vector $\mathbf{v}$:

$$
a\mathbf{v} = [ax_1, ax_2, ..., ax_n]
$$

### **c. Example**
Given vector $\mathbf{v} = [2, 3]$ and scalar $a = 4$:

$$
4 \times [2, 3] = [8, 12]
$$

## **2. What is a Matrix?**

### **a. Simple Definition**
A **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. You can think of it as a spreadsheet with multiple rows and columns.

### **b. Everyday Example**
Imagine an Excel spreadsheet where each cell contains a number. This grid of numbers is similar to a matrix.

### **c. Mathematical Representation**
A matrix is written using brackets with rows and columns. For example, a 2x3 matrix (2 rows and 3 columns) looks like this:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### **d. Visual Representation**
Think of a matrix as a table:

|   | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|---|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| **Row 1** |    1     |     2    |     3    |
| **Row 2** |    4     |     5    |     6    |

### **e. Uses in Algebra**
In algebra, matrices are used to solve systems of equations, perform linear transformations (like rotating or scaling shapes), and represent data in a structured form.

### **f. Uses in Computer Science**
Matrices are essential in computer graphics (transforming images), machine learning (handling large datasets), network analysis, and solving complex algorithms efficiently.

## **3. How Do Vectors and Matrices Work Together?**

### **a. Combining Vectors**
You can add vectors together or multiply them by numbers (scalars) to change their size or direction.

**Vector Addition Example:**

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\
4 \\
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
4 \\
6 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### **b. Matrix Operations: Addition and Subtraction**

In matrix operations, we can add and subtract matrices of the same dimensions. Let's explore these fundamental operations.

#### Addition Example:
Given two 2Ã—2 matrices:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4 \\
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
B = \begin{bmatrix}
5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Add corresponding elements:

$$
A + B = \begin{bmatrix}
1+5 & 2+6 \\
3+7 & 4+8 \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
6 & 8 \\
10 & 12 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

#### Subtraction Example:
Matrix subtraction can be expressed as: A - B = A + (-1)â‹…B

Given two 2Ã—2 matrices:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
3 & 5 \\
7 & 9 \\
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
B = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
4 & 6 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

First, calculate (-1)â‹…B:

$$
(-1)â‹…B = \begin{bmatrix}
-1 & -2 \\
-4 & -6 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Then add A and (-1)â‹…B:

$$
A - B = \begin{bmatrix}
3-1 & 5-2 \\
7-4 & 9-6 \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 3 \\
3 & 3 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Remember:
- **<span style="color:red">Matrices must have the same dimensions</span>**
- Operations are performed element by element
- These operations form the basis for more complex matrix transformations
